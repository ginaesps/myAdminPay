bodyParser ensures that your server handles incoming request through the express middleware 
(parsing the body of incoming requests is part of the procedure when handling requests)

? bodyParser: nmp package that parses incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.

bodyParser.json()
middleware for parsing json objects (several options)
Basically returns middleware that only parses JSON and only looks at requests where the content-type header matches the type option. This parser accepts any unicode encoding of the body.

bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true})
middleware for parsing bodies from the URL
Returns middleware that only parses {urlencoded} bodies and only looks at requests where the content-type header matches the type option. 
Only accepts UTF-8 encoding of the body.

app.use(bodyParser.json()) looks at the requests where the content-type: app/json header is present 
and transforms the text-based JSON input into the accesible variables 
under req.body.app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}) does the same for URL-encoded requests.

A new body object containing the parsed data is populated on the request object after the middleware. 
This object can contain key-value pairs, where the value can be a string or array (when extended is false), 
or any type (when extended is true).
